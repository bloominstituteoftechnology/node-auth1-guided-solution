## Before Class

### Instructor Resources

Include instructor-facing resources here. Examples could include links to guided project, and guided project solution code as well as miscellaneous instructor-facing FAQ guides, etc.

- üêô [Guided Project Starter](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/node-auth1-guided)
- üêô [Guided Project Solution](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/node-auth1-guided-solution)

### Student-Facing Resources & Materials [Optional]

#### External Resources [Optional]

These are high-quality resources that can supplement student learning and TK material.

\*Note: To maintain Training Kit as the single source of truth, add these resources to Training Kit, if you feel there are additional resources that your cohort needs that don't belong on Training Kit, list them here.

- üìù [Helpful Article](www.medium.com)
- üé• [Helpful Video](www.youtube.com)

#### Preclass Announcements [Optional]

Occasionally, it makes sense to have messages prepared that will be sent the night or week before a lesson. If you know you'll be teaching a particularly sticky lesson, or if this module is the start of a sprint or a unit, students often need additional messaging. Even if this message feels specific to your current cohorts needs, it is better to save that message for future use than to slack and throw it away. This space is to draft those miscellaneous messages specific to your current cohort or lessons needs.

### Training Kit Hour [Optional]

Combine the resources above into a Slack message to present to students at the start of Training Kit Hour. Include link to Training Kit content, required downloads, and other resources.

- üì• [Required Download](www.example.com)
- üíØ [Important Resource](www.example.com)

#### Training Kit Announcement [Optional]

Since these resources will be shared with students via Slack, it is often helpful to include a block that is easily copy-and-pasted into Slack. This is a great chance to include your personality as an instructor and set the tone for the day.

## During Class

### Morning Announcement

#### Entry Ticket

Entry tickets quiz students on material required to be successful in the day's lesson. The data gathered from the entry ticket can inform sections of the guided project where it would be helpful to emphasize content from previous modules. The link below needs to be shared with the students in Slack at the beginning of the lesson.

`https://forms.gle/bjzGxHm8HGckyj1H7`

[Example Entry Ticket](https://forms.gle/bjzGxHm8HGckyj1H7)

#### Daily Resources

The links below need to be shared with the students in Slack at the beginning of the lesson.

- üß© [Guided Project Starter](www.example.com)
- ‚ùì [Slido](www.example.com)
- üé• [Zoom Link](www.example.com)
- ‚úÖ [Entry Ticket](www.example.com)

#### Slack Message

After Training Kit hour the real fun begins! Use the headers below to compile resources and draft morning announcement.

Aggregate daily resources, entry ticket, and objective into one slack message to share before class begins. (Note: depending on your style, it may make sense to share at the start of Training Kit Hour, or at the start of lecture.)

\*Note: Posting Objectives is proven to improve instructor and student focus. Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjrU50EKtjc&list=PLUHJNxb4jAaZYqAMJ9P90u4JCSV3MsQkH&index=2&t=0s).

### The Hook

Often, it's a good idea to start with a question or activity that will help you gauge students' knowledge of the topic or any preconceived notions they might have. This can be as simple as taking a simple poll: "How many of you have heard of X?" This might also be a more thoughtfully designed poll or question that you post in Slack at the beginning of the day where you use the student responses to help shape/inform your instruction time.

Besides the knowledge-check discussed above, also develop a creative introduction to the topic that will stimulate interest and encourage deep-thinking. You could use a variety of approaches:

- personal anecdote
- historical event
- thought-provoking dilemma
- real-world example/case-study
- short video clip
- practical application demo
- probing question

Consider the following questions when planning your introduction:

- How will I check whether students know anything about the topic or have any preconceived notions about it?
- What are some commonly held ideas (or possibly misconceptions) about this topic that students might be familiar with or might espouse?
- What will I do to introduce the topic?

\*Note: More science! Hooks set a tone for deep, engaged learning and lead to statistically significant better results. Learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cArUHPZjilc&list=PLUHJNxb4jAaZYqAMJ9P90u4JCSV3MsQkH&index=30).

### Purpose

Here is where you make it clear **why** the students need to learn the material being covered, **what** they will be able to "do", and **how** they will show that they have learned the material.

You should communicate this to the students at the beginning of the lesson and reiterated throughout the lesson.

### Learning Activities

Here is where you plan the main body of the lesson. As you plan each example and activity/demonstration, estimate how much time you spend on each. Leave time for an extended explanation or discussion. Use the questions below to help design learning activities:

- What will I do to explain the topic?
- What will I do to illustrate the topic differently?
- How can I engage students in the topic?
- What are some relevant real-life examples, analogies, or situations that can help students understand the topic?
- What will students need to do to help them understand the topic better?
- How am I incorporating IWY (I do/ We do/ You do) loops into the project?
- What are time commitments I want to hold myself to? (i.e. I will be done with learning activity #1 by 9:30 am)

#### Check for Understanding

This is where you summarize how you will know if students are learning. You need to think about specific questions you can ask students to check for understanding. Write them out and paraphrase them in multiple ways. This prepares you to ask the questions in multiple ways to get the most responses from the students. You should also decide ahead of time which questions you want the students to respond to orally vs. in writing. Here are some questions to ask yourself as you go through this step:

- What questions will I ask students to check for understanding?
- What will I have students do to show that they are following?
- Going back to my list of learning objectives, what activities can I have students do to check they have accomplished each of those?
- What data will signify that I can move on in my lesson? (i.e. 70% correct)

The questions you create here should be pre-written and ready for the TLs to drop in Slack as a thread at the correct time during the lesson. The responses to the questions provide important real-time data that will help inform your decision to slow down, reteach/rephrase the most recent information, or move on.

_Note: An important strategy that will help you with time management is to anticipate students‚Äô questions. When planning your lesson, decide what kinds of questions will be productive for discussion and what questions might sidetrack the class. Think about and decide on the balance between covering content (accomplishing your learning objectives) and ensuring that students understand._

#### Schedule

Use this space to generate a rough outline of your lecture time using the guided project solution code and objectives as reference. Aim to include one demonstration per objective at a minimum.

While you might not stick rigidly to a schedule during class, the act of creating one can help ensure that you are sticking to your instructional goals, and give appropriate time to more important objectives.

| Time Stamp | Activity                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| 9:00       | Morning Announcement            |
| 9:05       | Hook                            |
| 9:10       | Demo Concept 1 (I do and We do) |
| 9:20       | Breakout Room 1                 |
| 9:30       | Break                           | n/a |
| 9:35       | Demo Concept 2 (I do and We do) |
| 9:50       | Breakout Room 2                 |
| 10:00      | Slido Questions                 |
| etc.       | etc.                            |

#### Demonstration 1

Nothing goes here. The `#####` headers that follow are sections that should be considered when planning a demonstration. You should expect to duplicate this section for as many demonstrations as exist.

##### Guided Project Code

This is the portion of the solution code that you will reveal in this demonstration.

`Here is some code that I will add to the guided project`

##### Key Points

- This is an important thing to say
- This is another important thing to say
- This is a third important thing, sometimes addressing a common misconception

##### Resources and Notes

Use this space to keep track of any resources - internal or external - that you want to share at this point in the lesson.

- üìù [Documentation](https://jestjs.io/)
- ‚å® [Exercise Breakout Link](https://codesandbox.io/s/objective-shamir-7qstq)
- üìè [Converter Formulas](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_length_converter.asp)

##### CFU

Include the CFUs you'll use for this demonstration.

##### Breakout

If you will be pushing students to breakout rooms at this point, include details about the `You Do` portion of the project here.

Again, this is a great place to draft a slack message with detailed instructions for students who need it.

### Differentiated Instruction [Optional]

Everyone learns differently and the more ways you can represent material, the better. Use the checklist below to consider what types of learning activities you are including in your lesson:

[ ] Video
[ ] Text
[ ] Independent learning (work on their own)
[ ] Collaborative learning (work in pairs, groups)
[ ] Modeling
[ ] Demonstration with a guided handout
[ ] Auditory (Podcast, audiobook, etc.)
[ ] Student Demonstration
[ ] Written response
[ ] Sketching a diagram/model
[ ] Oral defense (presentation, think-pair-share)
[ ] Teaching others
[ ] Other: **\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***

### At Bats [Optional]

Research suggests students need 22 "at-bats" or chances to engage with math/science material to fully grasp content, including work before class and homework. Use the space below to track how many attempts students get to engage with material from each objective. An at bat can be following along with an instructor, watching a peer, or completing a challenge on their own. The key here is that students are doing the objective.

Learn more about at-bats from Teach like a Champion [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtjRcf0UTZY).

| Objective    | At-bats |
| ------------ | ------- |
| learn to XYZ | 16      |

### Conclusion & Preview

You should now go over all the material you are covering in this lesson and summarize the main points. During instruction, you can do this by just going through the main points yourself, you can ask a student to summarize them, or you can ask all the students to summarize them in writing. These written summaries can then show what most students "got" and what they might have missed. You can quickly emphasize anything they might have missed at the beginning of the next lesson.

_Note: This is where you would drop your End of Class Announcement in Slack._

Besides summarizing the lesson, the conclusion of your lesson should also be a preview of the lesson to come. It's a chance for you to ignite their interest in future material and also help them make connections between what they just learned and what they will soon learn.

## After Class

### End of Class Announcement

#### Challenge and Resources

If there are any additional resources you'd like to share with your cohort, list them here. Where possible, these will be linked in the project repo or sandbox as well.

- üîê [Module Challenge](github.com/challenge)
- üìå [Helpful Resource](www.example.com)

#### Exit Ticket

Exit Tickets act as a final CFU to discern what student's gathered from lecture (before the challenge). The data gathered from the exit ticket can inform sections of the guided project the next day where it would be helpful to emphasize content from previous modules. They can also inform changes to be made next time this module is taught. The link below needs to be shared with the students in Slack at the end of the lesson.

Learn more about exit tickets from Teach like a Champion [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtaTMMo8J2o).

`https://forms.gle/641FadYDvwCDay9U9`

- üõë [Example Exit Ticket](https://forms.gle/641FadYDvwCDay9U9)

#### Reminders

Similar to the preclass announcements above, occasionally it will make sense to include module-specific reminders for special days.

#### Slack Message [Optional]

Aggregate resources, exit ticket, and reminders into one slack message to share at 11:00 Lambda Time (or when Lecture is finished).

## Post Mortem

After class, take at least 5 minutes to reflect on the lesson you taught today. What would you change for next time?

Make these changes to your lesson plan now, or jot down thoughts here so that you don't forget for the next cohort.
